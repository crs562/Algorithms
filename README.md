# Algorithms

## Problem 1 : Sum of Two Digits
**Sum of Two Digits Problem** : Compute the sum of two single digit numbers. <br/>
**Input** : Two single digit numbers. <br/>
**Output** : The sum of these numbers. <br/>
**Input format** : Integers a and b on the same line (separated by a space). <br/>
**Output fromat** : The sum of a and b. <br/>
**Constraints** : 0 <= a, b <= 9

## Problem 2 : Maximum Pairwise Product
**Maximum Pairwise Product Problem** : Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers. <br/>
**Input** : A sequence of non-negative integers. <br/>
**Output** : The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence. <br/>
**Input format** : The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a1,...,an (separated by spaces). <br/>
**Output format** : The maximum pairwise product. <br/>
**Constraints** : 2 <= n <= 2x10^5; 0 <= a1,...,an <= 2x10^5.

## Problem 3 : Sorting Problem
**Sorting Problem** : Sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing order. <br/>
**Input** : A sequence of n numbers <a1, a2, ..., an> <br/>
**Output** : A permutation (reordering) <b1, b2, ..., bn> of the input sequence such that b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

# Applications of Algorithms (You can try!!!)
1. **The Human Genome Problem** : identifying all the 100,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, storing this information in databases, and developing tools for data analysis.
2. **The Internet Information Problem** : Manage and manipulate the large volume of data, including finding good routes on which the data will travel, and using a search engin to quickly find pages on which particular information resides.
3. **Secure Electronics commerce System Project** : Provide privacy of personal information such as credit card numbers, passwords, and bank statements using public-key cryptography and digital signature.
